<h1>WELCOME TO ZENZONE!</h1>

As you can see there are 3 folders in this repo namely:
1. pp - This stands for "Procrastination Payback" which was the name of our webapp when this folder was started. This is the frontend of our application.
2. zz - This stands for "ZenZone" which is the name of our now. This was created as copy of our folder to fallback on in case of errors though it is now pointless since we are putting our code in GitHub.
3. server - This is the backend of our app.

<h3>STEPS TO TAKE</h3>

1. Clone this repo to your local system.
2. Open terminal and navigate to 'pp' folder then run the following command - npm install react-router-dom zxcvbn axios socket.io-client uuid
3. After this run - npm start
4. Now navigate to 'server' folder then run the following command - npm install express mongoose cors nodemon socket.io uuid express-session bcrypt node-cron
5. After this run - npm start
6. The project is now running!
